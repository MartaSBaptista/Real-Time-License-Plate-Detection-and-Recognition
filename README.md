# Real-Time-License-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition
This project extracts vehicles from video footage and saves them as image files. A trained model then identifies and extracts license plate numbers from the detected vehicles. The system automates vehicle detection and license plate recognition for traffic monitoring, enforcement, and surveillance purposes.
